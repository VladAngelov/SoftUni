# Website for Rent a car

This is a simple Website which can be used from a small company for rent a car.
There are three types users: 
* Guest
* Regular
* Administrator

*Guests* can see all cars, but to book, they must first **register and log** in to their accounts.

*Regular users* can view and book for a specific date if the car is available during that time.
They can also check all active rentals, full name, email and phone in their account. 
They can sort cars by price or date of manufacture and search by name.

The project supports **Administration**.

The *Administrator* has all rights a Regular User has.
The *Administrator* can also add, edit or delete cars.
